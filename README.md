## Requirements
You have to create a new user and a new database in MySQL.

Also, you have to register the app in [Spotify for Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and get your client ID and secret. You can follow [this tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/) for that.

When you have done all of that, replace the values in the [.env](.env) file.

**NOTE:** You have to activate the desktop notifications in Spotify app to work.

## Examples
- Notification:
